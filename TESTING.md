## Test Files

### 1. `src/__tests__/standings.test.ts` (18 tests)
Core tournament standings and playoff logic

**Categories:**
- **calculateStandings()** - 6 tests
  - Points calculation (win=3, draw=1, loss=0)
  - Goal difference & goals for statistics
  - Sorting by points, goal diff, goals for
  - Edge case: 0-0 draws
  - Edge case: Incomplete matches excluded

- **autoPopulateSemiFinals()** - 2 tests
  - Correct seeding: 1st vs 4th, 2nd vs 3rd
  - Preserves already-populated semi-finals

- **areSemiFinalsComplete()** - 3 tests
  - Validates both semi-finals completed with scores
  - Detects missing scores or incomplete matches

- **autoPopulateFinal()** - 2 tests
  - Populates final with semi-final winners
  - Handles draws (takes teamB)

- **isGroupStageComplete()** - 3 tests
  - All 9 group matches completed
  - All matches have valid scores

- **getFinalsMatchups()** - 1 test
  - Returns top 4 teams for playoffs

---

### 2. `src/__tests__/tournament.test.ts` (13 tests)
Tournament schedule generation and integrity

**Coverage:**
- Schedule structure (12 matches: 9 group + 2 semi + 1 final)
- Correct times and field assignments
- Round distribution (3 rounds × 3 matches)
- Each team plays 3 unique opponents
- No duplicate matchups
- No self-matches
- Unique match IDs
- Proper initialization (not completed, TBD teams for playoffs)
- Semi-finals use 2 different fields

## How to Read Test Files

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Feature Group', () => {
  describe('Specific Function', () => {
    it('should do specific thing', () => {
      // Arrange: Set up test data
      const input = { ... };

      // Act: Execute the code
      const result = functionUnderTest(input);

      // Assert: Verify results
      expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
    });
  });
});
```

### Assertion Patterns
```typescript
expect(value).toBe(expected)              // Exact equality
expect(array).toHaveLength(3)            // Array/string length
expect(team.points).toBe(3)              // Property value
expect(teams.every(t => t.id)).toBe(true) // All match condition
```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in `src/__tests__/` directory
2. Import testing utilities and functions to test
3. Use existing test patterns for consistency
4. Run `npm run test:run` to verify

### Updating Tests
- Tests are independent and can run in any order
- Keep test data (mockTeams, matches) small and focused
- Use `beforeEach()` for test setup that needs resetting

## Documentation Files

- **TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Detailed test coverage documentation
- **README.md** - Project overview
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick command reference

## Next Steps

The test suite provides confidence that:
1. ✅ Standings are calculated correctly
2. ✅ Playoff seeding is accurate (1v4, 2v3)
3. ✅ Finals are automatically populated with winners
4. ✅ Schedule has no conflicts or duplicates
5. ✅ Each team plays exactly 3 group opponents

**Deployment ready!** All critical tournament logic is tested and verified.
