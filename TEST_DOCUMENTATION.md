# Cobras Tournament - Test Suite Documentation

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite for the Cobras 6-team tournament system with group stage, semi-finals, and finals.

**Test Framework:** Vitest
**Test Files:** 2
**Total Tests:** 31
**Pass Rate:** 100% ✅

## Test Coverage

### 1. Standings & Playoffs Tests (`src/__tests__/standings.test.ts`)
**18 Tests** - Core tournament logic

#### calculateStandings() - 6 Tests
- ✅ Correct calculation of wins, draws, losses, goals, and points
- ✅ Proper sorting by points (descending)
- ✅ Goal difference as primary tiebreaker
- ✅ Goals for as secondary tiebreaker
- ✅ Handling of 0-0 draws with correct scoring
- ✅ Incomplete matches excluded from calculations

**Key Validation:**
- Win = 3 points, Draw = 1 point, Loss = 0 points
- Goal difference calculated correctly (goalsFor - goalsAgainst)
- Sorting: Points DESC → Goal Difference DESC → Goals For DESC
- 0-0 draws properly award 1 point to both teams

#### getFinalsMatchups() - 1 Test
- ✅ Returns exactly top 4 teams from standings

#### isGroupStageComplete() - 3 Tests
- ✅ Returns true when all 9 group matches completed with scores
- ✅ Returns false if any match is incomplete
- ✅ Returns false if fewer than 9 matches exist

#### autoPopulateSemiFinals() - 2 Tests
- ✅ Populates SF1 (1st vs 4th) and SF2 (2nd vs 3rd) with correct seeding
- ✅ Does not modify already-populated semi-finals

**Bracket Seeding Validation:**
- SF1: 1st seed vs 4th seed
- SF2: 2nd seed vs 3rd seed

#### areSemiFinalsComplete() - 3 Tests
- ✅ Returns true when both semi-finals completed with scores
- ✅ Returns false if only one semi-final complete
- ✅ Returns false if either semi-final missing score

#### autoPopulateFinal() - 2 Tests
- ✅ Populates final with semi-final winners (higher score)
- ✅ In case of draw, awards to teamB (secondary logic)
- ✅ Does not modify final if semi-finals not complete

### 2. Tournament Schedule Tests (`src/__tests__/tournament.test.ts`)
**13 Tests** - Schedule generation and integrity

#### generateSchedule() Tests
- ✅ Generates exactly 12 matches (9 group + 2 semi-finals + 1 final)
- ✅ Correct distribution: 3 rounds × 3 matches = 9 group matches
- ✅ Correct playoff structure: 2 semi-finals + 1 final
- ✅ Correct times:
  - Group Stage: 4:40 PM, 4:45 PM, 4:50 PM
  - Semi-Finals: 5:05 PM
  - Final: 5:20 PM
- ✅ All matches initialized as not completed
- ✅ All match IDs are unique (12 unique IDs)
- ✅ Correct field assignments:
  - Group Stage: Fields 1-3
  - Semi-Finals: Fields 1-2
  - Final: Field 1
- ✅ Playoff teams initialized as "tbd"
- ✅ No duplicate matchups in group stage
- ✅ Each team plays exactly 3 different opponents (no repeats)
- ✅ No team plays itself in group stage
- ✅ Semi-finals use 2 different fields

**Schedule Integrity Validation:**
- 6 teams: Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Portugal
- Each team plays 3 unique opponents (complete coverage)
- 9 total matchups without duplicates
- Timeline: 4:40 PM → 5:30 PM (fits in 50 minutes with 10-min games + breaks)

## Edge Cases Tested

1. **0-0 Draws** ✅
   - Both teams receive 1 point
   - Goal difference = 0
   - Properly included in standings

2. **Tiebreakers** ✅
   - Points (primary)
   - Goal difference (secondary)
   - Goals for (tertiary)

3. **Incomplete Matches** ✅
   - Excluded from standings
   - Do not affect group stage completion
   - Semi-finals detection requires all scores

4. **Same Points/Diff** ✅
   - Correctly sorted by secondary/tertiary criteria
   - Goals for differentiates identical point/diff teams

5. **TBD Populations** ✅
   - Playoff teams populated from standings
   - Semi-final winners populate final
   - Already-populated matches not re-populated

## Integration Points Tested

1. **Tournament Data Flow**
   - Schedule generation → Match tracking → Standings calculation
   - Group completion → Semi-finals population → Finals population

2. **Real-world Scenarios**
